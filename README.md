## Case Study: Multiple Linear Regression(One Hot Encoding)

Multiple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between a quantitative dependent variable and two or more independent variables

### Goal: 
- To create a model for the prediction of car price based on numerical features (age, mileage) and catergorical feature (car_model)
- To demonstrate how to encode categorical variable using ColumnTransformer and make_column_transformer module.
- To Test the model by predicting the price of two car based on their numerical and categorical input features. 

##### Note: This prediction is just a practice study
